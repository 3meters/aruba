Delete entity
Delete all drops that reference entity
If deleteChildren {
	For each childEntity that has entity as the parent {
		delete childEntity
		delete all drops that reference the childEntity
	}
}
else {
	For each childEntity that has entity as the parent {
		set parent to null
		delete all drops that reference the childEntity and the parent entity
	}
}
- For any entity deleted
	- If imageUri points to an image on S3 then
		- Set releaseDate property to date it is ok to delete the resource from S3
		
Open Issues
- Should we move all linkage references to the drops?
